                We all have days where we just don’t feel like doing anything.<br><br>

                It’s raining out, you didn’t get enough sleep, its cold, and you’re hungry. You had a crappy day at work, your girlfriend dumped you, and your dog ate your homework, whatever. It’s these moments when we just want to curl up on the couch, play video games and feel sorry for ourselves.<br><br>
                
                However and I know this isn’t surprise to you- these are the moments when it’s MOST IMPORTANT to stay on target: to stay consistent, to keep training, and to keep pushing. If you let yourself off the hook every time you have a bad day, you will train yourself to believe its okay to give up any time you meet resistance.
